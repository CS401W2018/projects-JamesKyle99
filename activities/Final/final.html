      <h3>Title and Topic</h3>
        <p>= CSR Team Members </p>
        <h3>Why This Topic</h3>
        <p>= I chose this topic because I currently work in ITO department under the Client Services team as technical support. I would like to introduce our department more to students of BYUH and introduce them to the hardworking student workers of CSR. </p>
       <h3>Content</h3>
        <p>- The Home page will contain navigation links to other 4 pages and contain the welcome section with our mission and overview of our services. </p>
        <p>- The 2nd page will be the team members page with a table consisting of the member details with a footer containing contact info</p>
        <p>- 3rd page will contain the services we offer and description</p>
        <p>- 4th page will be the resources page where you will find FAQ's and maybe some video tutorials as well</p>
        <p>last page will be the form page where students can reach out to us through filling up a form</p>

       <h3>Form and table</h3>
       <p>Form will be the request form to reach out to us when they receive a problem and the table will be used to input the members information</p>

       <h3>References</h3>
       <p>I will be using the ITO BYUH website as one of my references and the official byuh website. I will be collecting ingformation from my co workers and permission from our supervisors</p>
