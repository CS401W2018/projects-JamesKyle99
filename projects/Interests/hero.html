        <p>Spiderman or also known as Peter Parker, is one of my all time favorite fictional superhero 
            ever since I was a kid. His story arc is what I admired the most. He was just a teenager
            when his life changed forever when he was bitten by a radioactive spider.
            At a young age, he learned the importance of sacrifice and responsibilites. One of the most famous quotes from that movie states
            " With great power, comes great responsibility". This not only applies to his life, but to all of us as well.
