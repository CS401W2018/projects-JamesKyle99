            <p>The Avengers are a team of mighty superheroes who defend the earth from various villains of each individual hero. In the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe), the first 6 avengers to ever assemble were Captain America, Iron man,The Hulk, Thor, Black Widow, and Hawkeye. All of them were assembled by the director of S.H.I.E.L.D, Nick Fury. </p>
            <p>Throughout the years, the members of the Avengers team grew as the threats of the earth grew more dangerous. In the next few years, heroes such as Dr. Strange, Ant-Man, Captain Marvel, Spiderman, Black Panter, and more, have joined the team. As they face the greatest threat the earth has faced, named Thanos, he must also face the wrath of the earth's mightiest heroes. </p>
