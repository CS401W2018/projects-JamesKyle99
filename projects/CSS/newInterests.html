            Ever since I was a kid, I have always admired super heroes in comic books and cartoons.
            The <span class="red">Marvel Cinematic Universe</span> are cinematic adaptations of iconic comic book characters like
            Spiderman, Captain America, Black Panther, The Hulk and many more. It was every child's dream to see these characters come to life,
            and to see each character interact with each other with great storylines made it better.

            What I love about this universe is its not only about fictional superhero movies but each 
            character teaches all of us valuable lessons in life. Al though fictional, they relate the
            lives of these superheroes to real life situations we encounter in everyday life, like
             responsibilites, family matters, friendship, and even anxiety and depression that a lot of kids
             these days experience. Factors like these, are what makes me a fan of this universe.

        <li class="emp">I used this color to emphasize text</li>
        <li class="new">I used this color to de-emphasize text</li>
        <li> I searched online on what colors will contrast with my background color which is Bisque. Teal contrast well with Bisque so I used that to emphasize and anything yellow beige does not contrast so I used the burleywood</li>
